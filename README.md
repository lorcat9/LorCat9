<h3><b>About me</b></h3>

<p>I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen and a BSc on the same topic from Roma Tre University. 

My professional experience covers multiple roles related to software development, with a focus on cloud infrastructures. I also enjoy discussing on macroeconomics, city mobility and sports.
